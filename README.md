Codewars.com learning katas in Kotlin

## Description
The aim is to create a structure for learning Kotlin by solving katas in TDD fashion and scaffold the project structure
so it helps to focus on the problem solving rather than setting up the project.

## Acknowledgement
This repository is for trainings by [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) and was inspired by the project structure
[CodeWars-Kotlin repo](https://github.com/tlgbltcn/CodeWars-Kotlin).
